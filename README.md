# BookSuck
This is a repository for my project BookSuck.

It is intended to be private repository for my use.

Information about my program can be found from booksuck-README.txt.

If you want to run the source code, then you need the following depencies:
- python 3
- cloudscraper
- tqdm

If you do not have these use pip to install them.

If a executable folder has a "onefile" on it's name, then you only need to download the one file inside. If there is no "onefile" on the folder, the you need to download the specific folder with the wanted program version, in it's entirety. Inside this folder is the executable which can be used to run the program. Other files on the folder are depencies and resources.
