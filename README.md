# BookSuck
This is a repository for my project BookSuck.

Information about my program can be found from booksuck-README.txt.

If you want to run the source code, then you need the following depencies:
- python 3
- cloudscraper
- tqdm

If you do not have these use pip to install them.

Github repository only has the programs source code. If you want to have a executable version, then you can download them from this Google drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-_YRMVwOQR8fLahNohXtPSfA4vzWnJ4B?usp=sharing

The executable versions are made with a program called pyinstaller, in a macOS Catalina version, Windows 10 and Parrot Home (Debian based).
-> Sidenote, I have noticed that somehow some executable files have stopped working, even if it was previously working. This could be because of some updates to my emulator or on the libraries of my code.

If a executable folder has a "onefile" on it's name, then you only need to download the one file inside. If there is no "onefile" on the folder, the you need to download the specific folder with the wanted program version, in it's entirety. Inside this folder is the executable which can be used to run the program. Other files on the folder are depencies and libraries.
